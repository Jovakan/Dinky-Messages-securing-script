# Dinky-Messages-securing-script
Made a small dinky automator script that basically makes you put in a password before you can open your Messages on your mac. 


# Instructions
Just unzip the file and drag it to your applications folder or your doc and get rid of your messages app from your doc if you want to make it more obscure for other users on your laptop. The original password on it is "*Caulker*", if you want to change it, change the code on automator. The icon for it is bigger than the regular messages icon just so you can differentiate the two if they're side by side and totally not because I couldn't be bothered to find an icon the same size. You also need to keep your messages app installed since this is basically just a shortcut to the app not like an actual standalone client. 

Anyways have fun and do whatever you want with the code
